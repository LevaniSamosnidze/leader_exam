# Problem 10: Edit Distance - 10áƒ¥
# Challenge:
#  Given two strings word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert
#  word1 into word2. You have three operations allowed: insertion, deletion, or substitution.
# Instructions:
# Input: Two strings word1 and word2 (e.g., "horse", "ros").
# Output: The minimum number of operations required to convert word1 into word2.
# Test Cases:
# assert min_distance("horse", "ros") == 3
# assert min_distance("intention", "execution") == 5
# assert min_distance("kitten", "sitting") == 3
